The input range style should be customized based on the wire frame. The circumference should be drawn in the canvas in an ARC manner (example: http://www.we-r-here.com/cad_08/tutorials/level_2/images/arctext_sample.gif), the radius also is drawn above the radius line in the canvas. The other canvas on the right draws the hieght of the circle.
